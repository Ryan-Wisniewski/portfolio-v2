                            Project Firefly is a game that teaches young children how to think like an engineer. 
                            Our team of 7, along with the website stakeholder, met weekly to discuss progress to ensure the product was released in a timely manner. 
                            We built the user flow to increase readability and functionality by separating the game data from the users. 
                            The team and I matched the product to the vision of the stakeholder by implementing the design canvases provided.
